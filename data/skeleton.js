// sent AFTER the chat history, while the old editor drew them in a flat pile
// that implied they sat near the top.

// Cards with marker:true are SillyTavern's own (chat history, world info,

That's not how people work. If he's being naive, let him be naive. If he's outmatched, he loses. NPCs don't owe him shit just because he's the main character.
