You are a precise location archivist for a roleplay. Your ONLY job is to detect whether the scene has left the current known location.

Current known location: {{current_location}}

{{history}}

Latest message:
{{message}}

At the END of the latest message, has the scene clearly left the current known location?

Rules:
- Answer with ONLY the single word YES or NO.
- Evaluate the scene state strictly at the end of the latest message, not during earlier parts of it.
- YES = the characters are no longer in the current known location.
  This includes:
  - clearly exiting the location (e.g. stepping outside)
  - being in transit after leaving (e.g. on the road, in a vehicle, traveling)
  - arriving somewhere after previously being in transit
- NO = they are still within the current location or its immediate sub-areas (different room, floor, corner, or nearby extension).
- Movement within a location does NOT count as leaving.
- Intent to leave does NOT count; the exit must be completed.
- Mentions of other locations without physically moving do NOT count.
- If the location is ambiguous or unclear, default to NO.
- Do not explain. Do not add any other text.

Answer:`

export const DEFAULT_CLASSIFIER_PROMPT =
`[SYSTEM: TASK — LOCATION CLASSIFIER]
Identify which location from the list below matches the location at the end of the LATEST MESSAGE.

CURRENT LOCATION: {{current_location_name}}

LOCATIONS:
{{key_list}}

TRANSITION HISTORY FROM CURRENT LOCATION:
{{spatial_transitions}}

NUMBER OF TRANSITIONS TO A COMPLETELY NEW LOCATION ({{spatial_discovery_count}})

PREVIOUS History:
{{history}}

LATEST MESSAGE:
{{message}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. If the characters have moved to a NEW location not listed above, reply: NEW
2. If the characters have moved to a location in the list above, reply ONLY with the ID in brackets (e.g., [fob_armory]).
3. If the characters are STILL at {{current_location_name}}, reply: NULL`

export const DEFAULT_DESCRIBER_PROMPT =
`[SYSTEM: TASK — LOCATION ARCHIVIST]
Analyze the roleplay transcript to identify the current physical location.

TRANSCRIPT:
{{context}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the single most specific active location at the end of the transcript.
2. Provide the information using the exact labels below:
   Name: A short, formal label (e.g., "The Silver Swan Tavern").
   Definition: A brief, conceptual definition of what this place is. This helps distinguish the location and narratively for search logic.
    Visuals: 2–3 sentences of concrete visual detail for an image generator. Focus on visible elements such as lighting, materials, layout, and color. Exclude mention of humans, animals, and any other living creatures.

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
Name: [Location Name]
Definition: [Logical Definition]
Visuals: [Image Generation Prompt]`

Create a new location definition based on the user's keywords and the current roleplay context.

USER KEYWORDS: {{keywords}}

TRANSCRIPT CONTEXT:

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Prioritize the USER KEYWORDS as the primary theme for the location.
2. Use the TRANSCRIPT CONTEXT to refine the mood and world-consistency.
3. Provide the information using the exact labels below:
   Name: A short, formal label based on the keywords.
