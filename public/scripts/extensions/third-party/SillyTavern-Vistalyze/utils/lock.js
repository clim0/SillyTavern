 * Implements a simple Mutex (Mutual Exclusion) lock for asynchronous operations.
 * 
 * In the Vistalyze architecture, this utility is used by the DNA Writers to 
 * ensure that writes to the chat log (JSONL) are serialized. This prevents 
 * "lost updates" when an AI message received event and an image generation 
 * completion event attempt to patch the same message simultaneously.
 *

 * class AsyncLock
 *   acquire() -> Promise<void>
 *   release() -> void
 *
 * @contract
 *   assertions:
 *     purity: pure mechanic
 *     state_ownership: [internal queue]
