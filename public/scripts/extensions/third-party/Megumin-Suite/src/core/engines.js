// globalAndBlocks and storyconfig — the same expression, four times. That is how
// V10 came to announce itself as V9 in two different places: V10 was flagged
// `isV9` so it would inherit V9's behaviour, and every site that turned the flag
// back into the WORD "V9" was suddenly lying. Fixing one did not fix the others.
//
// So: one spelling, and behaviour asked for by name rather than by generation.
// A screen that wants to know what to CALL the engine reads `engine.label`; it
// never reconstructs the name from a flag.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// already has the engine in hand, and keeping this dependency-free means any
// layer can use it.
