[Unfiltered internal layer hidden from the PC. Reveals what NPCs truly think, feel, and say when the player isn't meant to hear.
- If multiple NPCs are present: render this as private dialogue between them, spoken behind the PC's back. They drop their public masks and reveal their real opinions, motives, alliances, and grudges.
- If only one NPC is present: render this as raw, unspoken thought inside that character's head stray feelings, regrets, judgments, and memories.
- max Length is 30 words.
Tone is honest and unguarded, contrasting with whatever the character shows on the surface.
Example (single NPC – the father):
"NPC NAME: What a disappointment of a son... I miss my wife. She'd know what to say to him. I never did."]
